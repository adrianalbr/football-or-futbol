## Welcome to our Project!
My team and I have developed a fully functional web application that showcases CRUD functionality. Football or Futbol is an application designed for sports enthusiasts to compare and contrast a football player and a futbol player. Not only can they do that but they can also make the selected players go head to head in a VS game mode to obtain a winner via their stats. Since their is CRUD implementation, the user can also create their own player with their desired stats as followed:     
    - Acceleration
    - Speed
    - Strength
    - Agility
    - KickPower
    - Tackle
    - Jumping
    - Stamina


## Inspiration
We of course took inspiration from our love of the beautiful game and wanting a way to compare athletes of different sports. Realizing there is no application out there, why not build it ourselves:)


## Installation
Follow these steps to view the application!
1. Open link in github. - https://github.com/adrianalbr/football-or-futbol
2. Clone with SSH
3. Run "git clone" command in Terminal with the pasted link
4. Run "code ." command to open in VS Code.
5. Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies 
6. Change config.json file accordingly 
6. Run 'npm start' to initialize the server on your local if you wish to view it there.
7. Enjoy


## Usage
The user signs up or logs in and they are presented with a choice - Football or Futbol. Then the user is directed to a page where they can select a player or create a player with their desired stats. Once this is done the user can select or create a player from the other sport.
Once both players are selected they battle! Stats from both players are compared and a winner is declared. Users can also create their own players, maybe even create themselves to see how they measure up against PRO athletes. The application includes a database with 200 PRO players that the user can compare.


## Tools Used
This application was developed using these wonderful technologies:
    - Node and Express
    - Handlebars
    - MySQL database
    - Sequelize
    - Heroku
    - new technology??
