...the stats will decide!

## Objective

Welcome to Football or Futbol, the application that will help you to decide once and for all who is the better athlete, a Football player or a Futbol player.

This application allows the user to select or create a Football and a Futbol player to compare them based on the following attributes:

    - Acceleration
    - Speed
    - Strength
    - Agility
    - KickPower
    - Tackle
    - Jumping
    - Stamina

## How it works

The user logs in
The user selects the first player
Selects the second player
and then we battle!! Stats for both players are compared and a winner is declared

Users can also create their own players, maybe even create themselves to see how they measure up against PRO athletes.
