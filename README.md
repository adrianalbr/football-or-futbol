...the stats will decide!

## Objective

Welcome to Football or Futbol, the application that will help you to decide once and for all who is the better athlete, a Football player or a Futbol player.

## Inspiration

To prove Futbol’s superiority. After all the rest of the world can’t be wrong!

## How it works

The user signs up or logs in and they are presented with a choice - Football or Futbol. Then the user is directed to a page where they can select a player or create a player. Once this is done the user can select or create a player from the other sport.
Once both players are selected they battle!
Stats from both players are compared and a winner is declared.

Users can also create their own players, maybe even create themselves to see how they measure up against PRO athletes.

The application includes a database with 200 PRO players that the user can compare.
